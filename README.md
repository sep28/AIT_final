# NBA myGM Lite

## Overview


Have you ever wanted to manage and run your own NBA team? Well now you can, using NBA myGM!

NBA myGM is a web app that will allow users to keep track of players on their team. Users can register and login. Once they're logged in, they can create or view their NBA Team. Users can add Players to their team and fill in each player's information (height, weight, position, age, skills). Users can also choose to remove a player from their team. 

## Data Model


The application will store Users, Teams, and Players

* users can have multiple Teams
* each Team has basic info (location, mascot, colors, coach)
* each Team can have multiple Players (by embedding)
* each Player has basic info (height, weight, age, position) and a list of attributes


An Example Team:

```javascript
{
  location: // Team location,
  mascot: //Team mascot,
  color1: //Team color 1,
  color2: //Team color2,
  coach: //Team coach,
  roster: // an array of references to Player documents
}
```

An Example Player:

```javascript
{
  user: // a reference to a User object
  name: "John Doe",
  height: "6'4",
  weight: "205",
  age: "34",
  position: "guard",
  skills: "Shooter, Hustle Player",
  createdAt: // timestamp
}
```

## Research Topics


* (3 points) Perform client side form validation using a JavaScript library
    * I will have JS code to ensure that all form content is valid and does not cause any errors
    * This is important because I will have forms on almost every page of my web app
    * The form content is also used to build my Teams and Players and store within DB
* (3 points) Unit testing with Mocha
    * Will be testing my project with Mocha to ensure all errors are caught and handled prior to deploy
    * This will help ensure that my code runs as planned, ensuring each action (add/remove) is performed properly to make sure my db is maintained properly
* (2 points) Use a CSS Preprocessor
    * I will learn and use Sass as my CSS Preprocessor 
    * I will do this because my HTML/CSS is slacking and I believe Sass could help me with my CSS
    * Sass will allow me to organize my CSS to my HTML file and use variables for Team Color displays
